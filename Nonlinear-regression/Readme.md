# Non-linear regression on california housing dataset using convolution neural network


<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project mainly calculate matrices (accuracy, precision, recall, f1score) on text data using CNN model which uses NLP methods to clean the data and make it suitable for deep learning model.

### Built With

Tools and framework used in the project. Here are a few examples.
* python
* Sklearn
* Keras


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Step by step guide of how project works

### Prerequisites

Any IDEs for python.
* Jupyter Notebook

### Dataset

Work on rotten-tometo movie review dataset. It's available over [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cacoderquan/Sentiment-Analysis-on-the-Rotten-Tomatoes-movie-review-dataset/master/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/parthvalani/Natural-Language-Processing.git
   ```
3. Install python packages
   ```sh
   pip install pandas sklearn numpy
   ```


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Methodology

* load the train and test data from above link
* data preprocessing
* bag of word vectorizer for phrase and sentiment
* split phrase and sentiment as a train and test set
* one hot encoding of output
* built a simple 1D CNN model with hyper-parameter tuning
* train the model
* count every stastical attribute including loss and accuracy
